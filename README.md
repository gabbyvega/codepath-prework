## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[Video](https://opensource.com/article/21/1/learn-javascript)

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I did not have the second else in the game logic. I did try to base it off of the flowchart but I completly skipped over the the second question. I used the open source resource to compare my statements and figure it out. As I was playing it would not understand the turn was completed and the second time it would skip to the 8th pattern.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Is this as easy as it gets? I try not to say that with arrogance. Growing up I would watch my older cousins modify their MySpace themes with HTML, javascript, and CSS files. They would add gifs to their backgrounds and playlists or hide certain bestriends. I went on to do similiar with tumbler at the age of 13. I played a lot with fonts, margins and external links to archives.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours I would try to create a small song wihtin the pattern sequences. Something like twinkle twinkle little star ot hot cross buns. I had time to play with the sliders but not enough to pin point the frequences I wanted. I would want the player to get to the 7th turn before they realized. Then chaange the song on each try.]
